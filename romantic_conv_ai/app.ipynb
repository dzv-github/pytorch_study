If you’re using a recipe, it’s always best to follow it exactly the first time you make it. But if you’re looking to add your own twist, try adjusting the amount of sugar or salt to taste. And don’t forget the importance of mixing, whether it’s using a hand mixer or a stand mixer, make sure everything is well combined. Finally, don’t skimp on the baking time, it’s crucial to follow the recommended time in the recipe. I hope that helps! *Hiroshi says, smiling and handing you a business card with his favorite recipe for chocolate chip cookies.* If you have any other questions, feel free to come back and ask!',\n",
